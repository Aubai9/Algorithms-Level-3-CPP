# 🧩 Algorithms Level 3 - Matrices & Strings

This repository contains my solutions for Course 7 in the "Foundations of Programming" track by Eng. Mohamed Abu-Hadhoud.

In this level, the focus shifts to Data Manipulation using C++. It involves solving complex logical problems related to 2D Arrays (Matrices) and String Manipulation without relying on built-in libraries, to build strong problem-solving muscles.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Matrices (2D Arrays)
Solving 30+ problems involving:
*   Random Matrix Generation & Printing.
*   Row/Column operations (Sum, Max, Min).
*   Matrix Transpose, Palindrome Matrix, and Identity Matrix checks.
*   Comparing two matrices and checking for typical/scalar properties.

### 2️⃣ Strings
Deep dive into string handling:
*   Building custom string functions from scratch.
*   Splitting, Trimming (Left, Right, All), and Joining strings.
*   Counting words, letters, and vowels.
*   Replacing words and reversing text logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies
*   Language: C++
*   Concepts: Modular Programming, Logic Building, Memory Management.
